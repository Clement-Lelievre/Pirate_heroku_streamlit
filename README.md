Hosting on Heroku the streamlit app solving the pirates puzzle:

# ☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️
    # Pirates need to share their gold bullions.

    ## To do so, they proceed in the following way:

    ### Starting from the oldest pirate, each pirate offers a **split of the bullions**.
    ### Then, all pirates (still in the game) **vote either for or against this split**.
    ### If the split gets an *absolute* majority of votes, then the split is accepted, implemented and the game is over.
    ### Otherwise, the pirate whose split was just rejected is out of the game (he can no longer vote nor receive bullions), and it is the next pirate's (age-wise) turn to propose a split
